      <h2>For users:</h2>
      <p>Welcome! To add recipes, go <a href="/add-recipe">HERE</a>
       To browse recipes, go <a href="/browse">HERE</a></p>

      <h2>API Information</h2>
      <p>The api endpoint is at <a href="/recipes">/recipes</a></p>
      <h3> Parameters:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>name - finds recipes with this exact entire phrase</li>
          <li>searchterm - finds recipes with titles that contain this phrase</li>
          <li>ingredients - for searching for recipes with certain ingredients. Seperate them with commas!</li>
          <li>limit - limits the number of results sent back. The default is no limit.</li>
        </ul>

        All of the parameters can be used at the same time, but I using the name parameter <br>
        at the same time as the other parameters would be redundant, since at this time <br>
        every recipe is required to have a unique name, so the name parameter will always come up<br>
        with just one recipe.<br><br>
        with just one recipe.<br><br>
        with just one recipe.<br><br>
        with just one recipe.<br><br>

        Using none of the parameters will send back every recipe. (for now)
